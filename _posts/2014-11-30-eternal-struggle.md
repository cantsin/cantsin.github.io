These days, I am aware that having a blog may be pass√©. And yet, after so many years, I am finally restarting my blog. Why?

<!--more-->

A few reasons.

- I love twitter and all that comes with it, but short-form postings simply do not promote deep thinking. Furthermore, twitter is partially designed to be an echo chamber. Sometimes I feel the need to express more substantial and in-depth musings about technical and social issues.

- While I do keep a personal journal, I'm starting to realize the value in keeping a public record of myself. There are not many deaf entrepreneurs out there, and I have quite a few stories to tell (but this blog will not be an exercise in solipsism!)

- I find that keeping a regular blog forces me to organize my thoughts. It helps me quantify my progress, keeps me sane and focused. With the startup grind as is, this is sometimes very difficult to do.

So what will I be talking about?

Mostly technology, for it pervades most of my entire life. Disability, for it pervades my entire life.

And literature on the side, for it is my escape, "the axe for the frozen sea inside," as per Franz Kafka.
