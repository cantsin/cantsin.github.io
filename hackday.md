`Game Lost Crash` is a monthly hackathon for disabled professional programmers; the focus is on exploring new technologies, algorithms, and technical ideas.

Our current project is an online distributed meta-verse as a gaming platform, built on [Lua/Love2d](https://love2d.org/), [Bitly](https://github.com/bitly)'s [NSQ](http://nsq.io/), and [Go](https://golang.org/), with a few side projects in [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Haskell).

There is also a dedicated IRC channel on [freenode.net](https://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml): `#gamelost`.

We welcome anyone, regardless of disability status. We have a dedicated videoconferencing machine for these who want to attend remotely from other states. We usually meet at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.openhorizonlabs.com">Open Horizon Labs</a> offices.
