## About me

<img style="float:right; padding: 1em;" src="../public/images/profile.png" width="256px" height="256px" />

I am an entrepreneur based in Berkeley, currently engaged with my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.openhorizonlabs.com">third start-up</a> as Chief Product Officer. I have been deaf since the age of one, due to spinal meningitis.

I enjoy rock climbing, reading Roman socio-political history and contemporary philosophy, and hacking on functional programming [projects](https://github.com/cantsin).

I agree with Emerson when he says that "Every novel is a debtor to Homer." I consider the late David Foster Wallace to be the [novelist par excellence](http://www.brickjest.com/) of our era. I adore historians such as Ronald Syme and E. H. Carr.

I regularly host [hackathons](https://github.com/gamelost) for disabled professional programmers. We welcome anyone, and if you want to join, just drop me [a line](mailto:jtranovich@gmai.com).

*A dream of reason* is an allusion to the nature of both programming and philosophy.

You may contact me:

* via IRC (cantsin on [freenode.net](https://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml))
* by [email](mailto:jtranovich@gmail.com).
